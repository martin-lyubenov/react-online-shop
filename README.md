Hello, 

I am working on creating a simple online shop with React, React-Redux and React-Router.

Work in progress. Better styling will be added towards the end of the project.

Things to be included: 
- Authentication and different acounts
- Admin rights
- Loading of prodcuts from Back4app ( products will be very simple, just for show)
- Adding products to cart (saving)
- List of all purchased products 
- Adding products
- Stripe payment example
