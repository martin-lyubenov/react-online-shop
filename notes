TODO:
Choose a new Look for the shop
Change the whole look tobe for memes
structure of meme card, info to be send to backend
Add banner - form me on github ( to be done last)
Add spinners
make design responsive 
add backdrop to mobile menu and cart?
testing :(
Check if error handling can be done in the API file
Pagination?


A PUT request is send every time the cart is opened or closed ( as it is rerendered) - can be fixed by hidding it instead instead ( but it will be part of the DOM), is it worth it to do so? The cart is open and closed rather seldom so for now it will remain the way it is. 


New theme:
- meme shop
- name - MemeShopOver9000
- memes are free (well, they cost souls but that is not important)
- micro transactions joke?
- mobile menue to be on the left, shopping cart on the right ( one should close the other before opening)
