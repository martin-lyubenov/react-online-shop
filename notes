TODO:
testing :(
Check if error handling can be done in the API file
Cart should look way better
Add spinners to cart? 
Add banner - form me on github ( to be done last)
Pagination?


A PUT request is send every time the cart is opened or closed ( as it is rerendered) - can be fixed by hidding it instead instead ( but it will be part of the DOM), is it worth it to do so? The cart is open and closed rather seldom so for now it will remain the way it is.
