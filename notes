Add option to add products

- search? ( maybe by title?, can be in the All products and my products pages)
- clear shopping cart when you logout - when loading the cart it should be an authorize request?

TODO:
Change the whole look tobe for memes
structure of meme card, info to be send to backend
Add banner - form me on github ( to be done last)
testing :(



New theme:
- meme shop
- name - MemeShopOver9000
- memes are free (well, they cost souls but that is not important)
- micro transactions joke?
- mobile menue to be on the left, shopping cart on the right ( one should close the other before opening)
